Unfortunatley madCodeHook is only available for commercial usage, anymore.
I had to drop the non-commercial edition due to repeated misuse by malware.

If you're a company wanting to evaluate madCodeHook, please check out the
precompiled demos. Furthermore you can build full test programs and dlls with
this evaluation version. You will need to copy "madCHook.dll" to the system32
folder, though, and you'll have to manually start the tool "mchEvaluation.exe".
Otherwise your test projects won't work. Of course with the commercial edition
you don't need "mchEvaluation.exe", anymore. Furthermore with the commercial
edition if you're using Delphi or MSVC++, you'll also not need "madCHook.dll",
either.

I'm seriously sorry for all the good freeware programmers out there, who would
have liked to use madCodeHook for their projects. But the malware writers gave
me no other choice. If you have a good and well known freeware and *are*
already using madCodeHook for some time, you may send me an eMail. If I like
your software I may eventually (or not) make a free license available to you.
